# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied consistently across an application. The issue is intermittent and appears to affect specific components or pages, even when the classes are correctly defined in the `tailwind.config.js` file and properly imported into the CSS.

## Bug Description

Tailwind classes fail to apply in unpredictable ways. The HTML structure and CSS selectors appear correct.  The problem does not consistently reproduce across different components or sections of the application.  Debugging reveals no obvious syntax errors or misconfigurations within the Tailwind setup.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the inconsistencies in Tailwind CSS class application across different components or pages of the application.

## Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the problem by ensuring that the correct Tailwind directives are included in the build process and that there are no conflicting CSS rules overriding the Tailwind classes.  This might involve reviewing purging configurations and ensuring all components are correctly included in the build pipeline.
